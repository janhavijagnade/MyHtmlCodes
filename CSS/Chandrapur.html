            Chandrapur (earlier known as Chanda, the official name until 1964) is a city and 
            a municipal corporation in Chandrapur district, Maharashtra state, India. It is
             the district headquarters of Chandrapur district. Chandrapur is a fort city founded
              by Khandkya Ballal Sah, a Gond king of the 13th century.[1] The city sits at the
               confluence of the Erai river and Zarpat river. The area around the city is rich in
                coal seams.[citation needed]. Hence, Chandrapur is also known as the "Black Gold City"

            There are many Stone Age sites in Chandrapur District. Suresh Chopane, a renowned researcher,
             found many stone-age tools in the district, which has been displayed in his Rock Museum.
              Archeological finds, such as signs of pottery making, suggest inhabitation of the Chandrapur 
              area in Neolithic times.[3]
